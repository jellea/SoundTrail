# SoundTrail, audio in motion.
Field recording are fun and there are various platforms around which
serve fieldrecordings. When I bought my binaural microphones I wanted to
use them while biking (dutch, yes) around the city. It struck me there
are no platforms which allow you to have audio and location movements coupled.

I want to make an audio player which is allows you to plot a route on a
map and use that route as a timeline for the audio. While the audio
plays, you'll see the location pin moving over the route. You're also
able to click somewhere on the route to continue playing the audio at
the given time.
